      Since I'm an fishing enthusiast who lives in a city with multiple fishing spots and varying weather. I am  mainly interested in wind speed and -direction and           tides when I'm choosing where to fish. So instead of finding looking up the weather forecast for each fishing spot, I have create a programe that can easily give       me an simultaniosly visualization of how these conditions are for a couple of my fishing spots.
