<h1> Jakob's portofolio </h1>
<p> I am currently finishing a bachelor  degree at NTNU business school in Trondheim, specializing in Business Analytics. </p>
<p> I have a great deal of knowledge when it comes to Python and Excel, and I know the  basics of  HTML/CSS/JS. </p>
<p> In this portofolio you will find a combination of school- and personal projects. </p>
<p> If you  are interested about  reaching me; contact me -> <a href='https://no.linkedin.com/in/jakob-lindstr%C3%B8m-b71111207'> Jakob@LinkedIn </a> </p>
<br>
<p> This portofolio is quite young, just as my experience with coding. Therefore my portofolio will be supplemented as I come up with, create, and finish new projects. First of all I will focus on Python projects, and mainly data analysis projects. </p>
